Monitoring and Tracking New Mexico Seismicity

(Draft)

New Mexico has a long history of oil and gas exploration and production, especially in more recent years as operators have been unconventionally developing oil and gas assets in northern Permian Basin / Northwest Shelf within southest New Mexico.  

A consequence of this growth has been an increase in induced seismicity as a result of subsurface water disposal within proximity of pre-existing deep-rooted faults. Seismicity has increased dominantly within the Texas border of Permian development, but also within New Mexico.  

The New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NMOCD) is the governing body responsible for the regulation of oil and gas operations and have put in place a response system for combatting induced seismicity based on magnitude and proximity to active Salt Water Disposal (SWD) wells.

For operators in the area, it is critical to know immediately if, and when, there is a seismic event that will directly impact operations in an effort to both follow the NMOCD directives and also mitigate costly production shut-ins or delay completion operations. The sooner an operator knows the details of a seismic event, they can respond and make adjustments to their field operations, as necessary. 

To aid with this challenge, operators in New Mexico need prompt communication and a detailed map with the latest event in relation to water infrastructure to make timely decisions.  Continued monitoring and trends also help the team to predict and make mitigation decisions regarding potential future events.
